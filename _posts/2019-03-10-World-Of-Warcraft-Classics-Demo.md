Back in November of last year Blizzard launched a limited time demo of classic World of Warcraft, available during BlizzCon to both ticket holders and virtual ticket holders. It turns out those bugs players thought it had were actually features of the original game.

Blizzard’s intention with World of Warcraft Classic is to return players to Azeroth circa 2005 – 2006, before the Cataclysm that altered the world forever. To showcase this it focused on two areas players at the time will remember well, Barrens for the Horde and Westfall for the Alliance. While the demo excluded classic dungeons, Deadmines and Wailing Caverns, you could still experience such memorable quests as the search for Mankirk’s wife.

Players were spawned into the demo at level 15 and had a level cap of 19. You could choose from any class available at the time and each one played just as it did back then, incredibly faithfully it would appear.
