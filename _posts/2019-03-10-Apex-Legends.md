Over on the Apex Legends subreddit, Respawn has posted some new information about dealing with cheaters and spammers in the game. Respawn says it’s already banned more than 355,000 PC players using Easy Anti-Cheat, and that it’s implementing an in-game report function for the PC version of the game.

With its free-to-play business model and meteoric ascent to 50 million players, it’s no surprise that hackers and cheaters have made Apex Legends a target. Respawn says that while its Easy Anti-Cheat system is working to help identify players using cheats, but “the fight against cheaters is an ongoing war that we’ll need to continue to adapt to and be very vigilant about fighting.”
