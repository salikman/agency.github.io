There are two kinds of people in this life. Those who ask why, and those who ask why not? The maker of this madcap mod that transforms Resident Evil 2’s Mr. X into Thomas the Tank Engine is definitely one of the why nots.

Gaming can be an unwelcoming business at times, can’t it? You’d think that we could all get along and enjoy our mutual passion for video games, but it just doesn’t work out. People can be so judgmental. The Xbox One vs PlayStation 4 battles rage on in YouTube comment sections everywhere. As for PC players? Well, there are some who just think they’re above console gamers.

Specs-wise, PCs do have the advantage, of course. The main draw of PC gaming for those who aren’t into that sort of thing? Mods.

There are mods for absolutely everything you could ever want. Have you ever wanted a mod for Super Smash Bros. that gave Kirby human feet? No, of course you haven’t, because that’s a horrible sight that nobody should ever be subjected to. Nonetheless, it exists (though the YouTube account that shared the footage has since been terminated).
