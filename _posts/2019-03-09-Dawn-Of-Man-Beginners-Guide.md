Dawn of Man is a Stone Age survival game where you take control of a settlement and guide your people from the Paleolithic era, through to the Iron Age. Along the way, you must ensure their needs are met and help them to expand and evolve, without running out of resources or being defeated by the elements. Later eras will also see you expanding your defenses in order to fight off raiders.
