There are plenty of perks that come with being an Xbox Live Gold member--getting access to monthly free game giveaways is just one--and the latest bonus will be of particular interest for fighting game enthusiasts, Mortal Kombat fans in particular. Xbox Live is holding a Free Play Days event where Xbox Live Gold members can play Mortal Kombat X for free from now until Sunday, March 10 at 11:59 PM PST / 2:59 AM EST on Monday.

This free-to-play deal comes a little over a month before the release of Mortal Kombat 11, which launches on Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch on April 23. Many playable characters have already been announced, and our preview of the game's story and Towers of Time mode was promising. Read more about where to pre-order Mortal Kombat 11, which gives you access to a beta on March 28.

Mortal Kombat X introduced a new, smoother fighting engine to the series and a story mode that will appeal a lot to long-term fans who care about Mortal Kombat lore. In our Mortal Kombat X review, GameSpot's Peter Brown praised the game for its fantastic character designs and fighting mechanics. "A great roster with a wide range of diverse fighting styles and variations gives you plenty to play around with, and the new fighting mechanics add the right amount of depth to nudge Mortal Kombat X ever higher on the list of respectable fighting games," he wrote.
